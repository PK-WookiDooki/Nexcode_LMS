# React Base Template

Created a reusable React Base Template which have already installed necessary packages such as [React Router Dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main), [React Redux](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/quick-start) & CSS Framework like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation). I hope using this template could save a lot of time than creating a react project from scratch.

## Usage Instructions

Clone this repo to your pc

> git clone https://github.com/PK-WookiDooki/React_Base_Template.git

and then open the project in VSCode. After that run this command

> npm install

in your VSCode to install all the packages. Hope you could save time using this template.
